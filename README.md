# My Portfolio

## Introduction

Hello! My name is Nick, and I am a full-stack software engineer. I created this portfolio to share more about myself and showcase projects that extend beyond my resume. It is a SPA that is deployed on GitHub Pages, and can be found here: https://njsimm.github.io/portfolio/

## Technologies Used

In developing my portfolio, I utilized React, Material-UI, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. React-scroll was implemented to ensure smooth navigation across sections. Version control was managed through Git, ensuring efficient tracking and updates to my project.

## Highlights

My portfolio features a minimalist design that adapts seamlessly across devices â€” feel free to explore it on both desktop and mobile! It showcases a range of projects that demonstrate my proficiency with front-end and back-end technologies, as well as database management.

## My Roadmap

I am EXTREMELY eager and motivated to continue improving my skills as a developer. While I plan to deepen my expertise in my current stack, I am also excited to explore the following areas:

- **Lower-level programming**: Rust, Go, and C (lower-level programming really interest me!)
- **Higher-level programming**: TypeScript
